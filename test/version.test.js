// Version bookkeeping.
//
// Three places carry the version and they are only useful in lockstep:
//   - package.json      what npm publishes
//   - lib/shared.js     what the running panel reports
//   - CHANGELOG.md      what publish.yml cuts the release notes from
// A drift between the first two fails CI at the tag; a drift in the third
// does not fail anything, it just silently ships notes that say
// "Release x.y.z" and nothing else. This test makes all three loud.
