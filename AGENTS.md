# Agent guide

`dsh-treekeeper` is a Windows-only DSH host + web plugin. It reconciles the DSH job ledger with the OS process tree and offers guarded process-tree termination.

## Engineering

- Keep `package.json#version` and `lib/shared.js#VERSION` equal, and keep `README.md` / `README.en.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.en.md` in sync.
- The three marked blocks are generated from `dsh-mini-utility-dock`: `dsh-loopback-helpers` and `dsh-host-guard` in `lib/shared.js`, `dsh-utility-launcher` in `lib/client.js`. Edit the dock fragment and run the matching `*.sync` script (`loopback:sync` / `guard:sync` / `launcher:sync`); never edit a block. The guard block depends on the loopback block, so keep that order.
- `npm test` checks all three blocks against the dock version this repo pins (`launcher:check` / `loopback:check` / `guard:check`).
- `dsh-plugin-parity` (from the dock) is a manual diagnostic, not a CI gate: what it asserts cannot hold across checkouts that sit on different branches.
- Treat `lib/act.js`, the process allowlists, and the creation-time guards as safety-critical. Never widen what can be terminated without a test.
- Keep finding confidence, scope, source, and rule values consistent across the host, the client, and the agent tools.
- Report unsupported platforms explicitly: do not add an unverified non-Windows sampler.
- Read optional DSH services only inside `ctx.inject(...)` callbacks.
- The supported DSH floor lives in three places and must agree: the README badge, `engines.dsh`, and `peerDependencies['@deepseek-ai/dsh']` (marked optional in `peerDependenciesMeta` so npm never installs the host because of it). DSH's startup preflight compares that peer against the running version with prereleases included and disables the row when it does not match, and the only override is an exact-version `dsh plugin allow-version` exemption. The range carries no upper bound on purpose: a ceiling would disable this plugin on the host's next release, and the exemption path accepts an exact version only.
- The ambient `sidebar.session.row.*` occupants read only cached client facts and never cause a host read: the leading cell mounts on every idle row, so a fetch, a session binding, or a subscription there would turn a passive badge into per-row host work.

## Verify

```sh
npm test
npm run docs:check
node --check lib/index.js
node --check lib/client.js
npm pack --dry-run
```
